                    <p class="mb-0"> I love to be out and about hiking, on a walk around the lake, mountain biking or dirtbiking it really doesn't make a difference as long as I'm doing something.</p>
                    <p>I love to spend time with my wife Brooklyn and our little puppy Otis, anything with them is the the best time</p>
